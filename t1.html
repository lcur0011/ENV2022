        <p>The first two weeks of this unit allowed me to become familiar with the JMR, as well as improve my understanding of the steps involved in designing and creating a monitoring program. These steps are outlined by Lindemayer and Likens (2010) on the right. Monitoring also provides a baseline, which is key in the ongoing management of an ecosystem (Spellberg, 2005).</p>
        <p>In my opinion, the most valuable thing I learned during this period is the importance of planning (asking specific and clear questions and developing a clear method) to efficiently use time and resources during monitoring.</p>
        <p>Participating in these two weeks also made me realise the importance of sampling when monitoring and ecosystem – assessing every component in an ecosystem would be impossible. Samples should be selected in such a way that they are representative of the entire ecosystem, but I noticed this can be subjective at times.</p>
        <p>Ecologi should be using a sampling method such as <a href="https://www.studysmarter.co.uk/explanations/environmental-science/environmental-research/quadrats/" target="_blank">quadrats and/or transects</a> to assess an area as part of their revegetation program. The process should include assessing the land so that the action taken is appropriate for both the particular environment type (for example grassland or woodland) and its purpose.</p>
