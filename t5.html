      <h2 class="w3-container w3-light-grey"><b>Science in Decision Making</b></h2>
      <p>Science in decision making involves using data to make decisions. The state of environment reports we submitted throughout the semester provide a scientific basis to decide which management techniques to use for the JMR.</p> 
      <p>Ecologi can use a similar method by making an assessment of the vegetation, soil and water quality in the areas they wish to revegetate. This should be done as a collaboration between scientists and management <a href="https://search.issuelab.org/resource/a-decision-maker-s-guide-to-using-science.html">(Karrer et al., 2011).</a> </p>
      <p>I suggest that Ecologi outsource the data collection component to environmental scientists who can also make recommendations. Ecologi should aim to ask clear questions in order to both achieve data that will help resolve the problem and work to a clear solution (Lindemayer and Likens, 2010). </p>
      <h2 class="w3-container w3-light-grey"><b>Adaptive Management</b></h2>
      <p>Using science to make a plan should be one of the first steps in the revegetation program. The next step should be adapting. Adaptive management involves a cycle: <b>Plan &rarr; Do &rarr; Monitor &rarr; Review &rarr; Plan</b> <a href="https://terranova.org.au/repository/southern-slopes-nrm-collection/southern-slopes-information-portal-report-climate-change-adaptation-information-for-natural-resource-planning-and-implementation-1/southern-slopes-information-portal-report.pdf/view">(Wallis et al., 2015)</a></p>
      <p>Adaptive management in the JMR involves regular assessment of the reserve and making decisions based on results. The SOE report provides a baseline which can be used for comparison in order to accurately assess the development over time.</p>
      <p>Ecologi can employ a similar system: using the data from the scientists as a baseline and routinely reviewing the areas they strive to improve. This could involve bi-annual checks to as part of the 'monitor' section of the cycle. This would be followed by a review where the success of particular methods is determined, and then planning again, if necessary.</p>
      <p>Ecologi may decide not to have long-term revision of programs, which would make sense for the organisation. I recommend that they monitor over a short term (for example 2 years), in collaboration with the local communities, before passing the responsibilty of revegetation in the area entirely to the community.</p>
