                  <ul>
                  <li><u>Vegetation survey:</u> we used sampling techniques to assess the vegetation in the Jock Marshall Reserve. This involved recognising native and invasive species in 1m<sup>2</sup> quadrats. Quadrats were spaced 5m apart across transects. This was my first time doing any kind of environmental assessment so I found the entire process quite interesting. </li>
                  <li><u>Habitat hectares assessment:</u> we assessed various vegetation categories outlined by Victorian Energy, Environment and Climate Action (2004) and compare this to a benchmark value outlined for the particular EVC in order to determine quality of vegetation. This method accounts for variation between assessors. </li>
                  </ul>

            <ul style="font-size: x-large;">
              <li><u>Identifying native and non-native species:</u> while a list of species that can be found in the Jock Marshall Reserve are <a href="https://www.monash.edu/jock-marshall-reserve/fauna-and-flora/flora">listed online, </a> I personally struggled to identify native and non-native species. The best way to overcome this would be to regularly expose myself to plants, and pay attention to their characteristics. This means that even if I do not know a plant species, I can recognise when it is abundant or occurring in multiple locations.</li>
              <li><u>Making coverage estimates:</u> while I felt that I did not have difficulty with this, this method is subjective. Luckily, there are a couple ways to reduce discrepancy. Firstly, practice: it will get easier to determine an accurate value as you get used to making judgemnts. Secondly, compare judgements with another assessor: this is a way to determine whether you are in the correct ballpark with your estimates.</li>

            <h2 class="w3-text-blue-gray w3-center">Applications</h2>
            <ul style="font-size: x-large;">
              <li>Ecologi should first learn which <a href="https://www.environment.vic.gov.au/biodiversity/bioregions-and-evc-benchmarks">EVC</a> applies to the area. A comprehensive list of species present, like the one for the JMR, is unlikely to exist so it is important to work with the local community as their knowledge can be helpful. Otherwise, you can review EVCs to give hints regarding which species to expect in an area. This is also a good source for which species to use to revegetate the area.</li>
              <li>Ecologi needs to consider if the presence of invasive species will negate other revegetation efforts. High weed cover may stop new plants from growing, which would make revegetation efforts pointless.</li>
              <li>If weeds are a concern, consider developing a weed control plan to be used alongside the reforestation project. The Australian Plants and Animals Committee has a <a href="https://www.agriculture.gov.au/sites/default/files/sitecollectiondocuments/pests-diseases-weeds/consultation/aws-final.pdf"> weed management strategy (2017)</a> that Ecologi can use as a guide when outlining their weed control plan.</li>
